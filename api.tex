\rSec3[intro.fibers]{Fibers and Threads}

1 A \emph{fiber} is a single flow of control within a program, including the
initial invocation of a specific top-level function, and recursively including
every function invocation subsequently executed by the fiber. The execution
steps of a fiber are performed by a thread.

\tsnote{``Flow of control'' here refers to state necessary to program
execution, for example the contents of a processor's registers including its
instruction pointer, and the invocation sequence \xref{stacktrace.general} of
functions that have been entered but have not yet returned.}

2 A thread is always running exactly one fiber. Member functions of \fiber
([fiber.context.class]) can direct the calling thread to \emph{suspend} the
running fiber and \emph{resume} a designated other fiber. This transition from
one fiber to another is a \emph{context switch}.

3 An \emph{implicit fiber} is the default fiber on any thread. All other
fibers are \emph{explicit fibers.}

4 An explicit fiber is created using \fiber. Instantiating \fiber \emph{prepares} a
fiber, which can consume resources. A fiber can thus be in one of three
states: prepared, running or suspended.

5 When a thread first enters a prepared fiber, that thread becomes the
fiber's \emph{owning thread.} The owning thread never changes.
\tsnote{A thread is the owning thread of its default fiber.}
\tsnote{If a thread resumes a fiber owned by another thread, the behaviour is
undefined.}

\rSec2[fiber.context]{fiber\_context}

\rSec3[fiber.context.overview]{Overview}

1 A \fiber object is either \emph{empty} or \emph{non-empty}. A
default-constructed or moved-from \fiber is empty. Otherwise, a \fiber is
non-empty, and represents either a prepared or a suspended fiber.

2 An explicit fiber is prepared by passing an \emph{\entryfn} to \fiber's
constructor. At the first call to one of the \anyresume member functions,
that \entryfn is entered, and the fiber is running.

3 Every call to one of the \anyresume member functions on an accessible
non-empty \fiber object performs a context switch.
\begin{itemize}
    \item suspends the running fiber, making it the \emph{previous fiber}
    \item resumes \thisfiber, which was either prepared or suspended, making
          it the running fiber.
\end{itemize}
In addition, returning a non-empty \fiber from a fiber's \entryfn:
\begin{itemize}
    \item terminates the running fiber
    \item resumes \thefiber{the returned \fiber}.
\end{itemize}

4 When a prepared fiber is first entered, a synthesized non-empty \fiber
object representing the previous fiber is passed as a parameter to
its \entryfn. When a suspended fiber is resumed, a synthesized \fiber object
representing the previous fiber is returned from the relevant \anyresume
member function.
\tsnote{The synthesized \fiber object received in either of those ways might
represent either an explicit fiber or an implicit fiber.}

%% \rSec3[fiber.context.toplevel]{Implicit Top-Level Function}

%% On every explicit fiber, the behaviour is equivalent to calling the \entryfn
%% passed to \fiber's constructor from an implicit top-level function.
%% If the fiber is later
%% unwound, this conceptual top-level stack frame serves as delimiter: this point
%% is where unwinding stops.

5 When a running fiber returns a \fiber from its \entryfn, thus resuming the
designated fiber, the synthesized \fiber passed into the resumed fiber is
empty.

6 If a fiber's \entryfn returns an empty \fiber object, \cpp{std::terminate} is called.
If a fiber's \entryfn exits via an exception, \cpp{std::terminate} is called.

7 Regardless of the number of \fiber objects in the program, exactly one of them
represents each prepared or suspended fiber. No \fiber object represents a running fiber.

8 A \fiber object can optionally be constructed by passing an explicit
\cpp{span<byte>} in which to track the fiber's
\stdterm{invocation sequence}{stacktrace.general}. If at any time during the
life of a fiber the data storage required to track its invocation sequence
exceeds the \cpp{size()} of that \cpp{span<byte>}, the behaviour is undefined.

%% Returning a \fiber object from the explicit fiber's \entryfn is equivalent
%% to returning control to the implicit top-level function.
%% Similarly,
%% when \unwindfib unwinds a fiber stack, it conceptually returns the \fiber
%% object it was passed to the implicit top-level function. Either way, the
%% The
%% conceptual implicit top-level function is responsible for deallocating the
%% explicit fiber's stack memory on return from the \entryfn.
%% 
%% Similarly, on every implicit fiber, the behaviour is equivalent to passing control through an
%% implicit top-level function above \justmain and above the \entryfn for
%% each \thread.
%% The conceptual stack frame for this implicit top-level function delimits
%% stack unwinding for each of these stacks. If the fiber stack is unwound,
%% control is conceptually returned to this implicit top-level function.
%% The conceptual top-level
%% function for an implicit fiber does not deallocate the fiber's stack memory,
%% since the host environment will do that.

%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item
%%     \item If an empty \fiber object is returned to the conceptual top-level
%%     function for an explicit fiber, the calling thread is terminated.
%%     \item If an empty \fiber object is returned to the conceptual top-level
%%     function for the default fiber of an explicit thread, that thread is
%%     terminated.
%%     \item If an empty \fiber object is returned to the conceptual top-level
%%     function above \justmain, the process is terminated.

%-------------------------------- resume_with --------------------------------
\mbrhdr{template<class Fn> fiber\_context resume\_with(Fn\&\& fn) \&\&}

The operation of \resumewith involves at least two and possibly three fibers.
Within [fiber.context.mem], for exposition only:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Entering \resumewith performs a context switch.
    \item The \emph{calling fiber} is the fiber calling \resumewith.
    \item The \emph{target fiber} is \thefiber{\state}.
    \item \resumewith synthesizes a \fiber object representing the calling
          fiber. Let \cpp{caller} be that synthesized \fiber object.
    \item Because \resumewith suspends the calling fiber, return
          from \resumewith necessarily requires some other fiber to perform a
          subsequent context switch back to the original calling fiber.
          When \resumewith returns, that other fiber is the previous fiber.
          \tsnote{The previous fiber can be other than the target fiber.}
    \item Let \cpp{previous} be the synthesized \fiber object representing the
          suspended previous fiber.
\end{itemize}

At entry to \resumewith, the target fiber can either be in the prepared state
(not yet entered) or in the suspended state (waiting to return from \resumewith).

\begin{description}
    \item[---]
          If the running fiber is suspended, that implies that at some earlier
          time, it called \resumewith[other], where \cpp{other} was some
          non-empty \fiber object. In that case, let
          exposition-only \emph{internal-resume(\cpp{before})},
          where \cpp{before} is a \fiber object, denote the following sequence
          of steps:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Return \cpp{before} from \resumewith[other].
        \end{itemize}   
    \item[---] Otherwise, let \emph{internal-resume(\cpp{before})}
          denote the following sequence of steps:

                  and let \cpp{successor} be the resulting \fiber, then
            \item destroy \cpp{entry\_copy}, then
            \item if \cpp{stack\_copy} and \cpp{deleter\_copy} exist:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item execute \cpp{invoke(deleter\_copy, stack\_copy)}, then
                    \item destroy \cpp{deleter\_copy}, then
                \end{itemize}
            \item exit the running fiber, then
            \item reclaim implementation-provided resources, then
            \item direct the current thread to resume \thefiber{\cpp{successor}}, then
