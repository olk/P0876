\abschnitt{Appendix A: potential premature destruction of exception object}\label{exlife}

In \stdclause{except.throw} paragraph 4, the destruction of an exception
object is specified to potentially occur when an active handler for the
exception exits, not when a handler exits while the exception is still the
currently handled exception. It is possible to observe, with the Boost
implementation in an Itanium C++ ABI environment, cases where an exception is
destroyed at a different point than specified (and, in particular, when a
handler for the exception is still active in a fiber). Consider
\href{https://github.com/secondlife/3p-boost/blob/nat/exstate/tests/early_exc_destroy.cpp}{the following program}.
